A mural drawing robot and a gentle introduction to 3D printing

Makelangelo is a polargraph mural drawing robot.  It is intended to teach students about programming, physics, trigonometry, and electronics in a fun, goal-oriented way.  Makelangelo is scalable: our test models have ranged from 30cm^2 to 300cm^2.

## Instructions ##

Download the software from https://github.com/ideafablabs/Makelangelo  run from the last_official_release And once started make these setting changes.
Machine settings
Width 590.0 height 812.0
paper width These can be set to your paper size. Must be less then machine size
invert left should be checked.

Adjust pulley sizes they should both be 25.46

select a tool. you should do this for each one of the pens.
diameter for normal sharpie is about 1.
Set max feed rate to 1500
Set pen up to 70.
Set pen down to 130
Set lift speed to 120


You must set zero correctly before you start to draw. Zero is the center of the machine. There should be a
divit or mark where the gondala should be placed. use the jog motor, or on the draw screen, use the X and Y motion
commands. These will not be accurate until you set zero, but they will move the gondala around and you should be able
to place the gondala at the zero mark and then set 0. 
Once this is done the drawbot should now be able to draw a picture.

Makelangelo is derived from the work of Paul Fisher.  It is largely inspired by "Hektor":http://hektor.ch/ by JÃ¼rg Lehni and Uli Franke.
